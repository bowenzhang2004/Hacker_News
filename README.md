# Hacker_News
By doing data scraping in Python, I made a project that can perform data scraping on any website and display any important information you desire and make your browsing more efficient and simple. For example, this code displays all news on hackernews.com with more than 100 upvotes. It shows me the title, how many upvotes, and the links so I can have an eaiser time browsing and only look at the important and popular news.
