# Hacker_News
Utilizing data scraping techniques in Python, I developed a versatile project capable of extracting vital information from any website, thereby streamlining and enhancing your browsing experience. For instance, this application optimizes news browsing on hackernews.com by filtering and displaying news items with over 100 upvotes. It provides me with the title, the number of upvotes, and relevant links, enabling a more efficient browsing experience by focusing on the most impactful and popular news.
